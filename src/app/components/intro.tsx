                I&apos;m a frontend developer based in Essex, UK, with a focus
                on building user-friendly web experiences using modern
                technologies. I have experience with frameworks like React and
                Ember, and while my strength lies in frontend work, I also have
                a solid understanding of backend systems, helping me collaborate
                effectively across the full stack. I&apos;m familiar with Agile
                methodologies and apply OOP and SOLID principles to write clean,
                maintainable code.
            </p>
            <p className="pb-3">
                Over the years, Iâ€™ve delivered high-quality solutions across
                both in-house and freelance projects, working closely with
                developers, designers, and project managers. I&apos;m committed
                to continuous improvement through self-funded training and
                real-world problem-solving, and I aim to create thoughtful
                digital experiences while staying adaptable and curious in
                everything I do.
